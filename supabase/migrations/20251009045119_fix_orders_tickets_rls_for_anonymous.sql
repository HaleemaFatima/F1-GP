  # Fix RLS Policies for Orders and Tickets for Anonymous Users

  ## Changes
  - Update orders table RLS policies to allow anonymous users to create and manage orders
  - Update tickets table RLS policies to allow anonymous users to create and view tickets
  - This enables payment processing without requiring Supabase authentication

  ## Security Notes
  - Orders and tickets are still tied to user_id for tracking
  - Application logic controls data access

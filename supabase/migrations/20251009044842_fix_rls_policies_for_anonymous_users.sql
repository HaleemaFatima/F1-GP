/*
  # Fix RLS Policies for Anonymous Users

  ## Changes
  - Update RLS policies to allow anonymous (unauthenticated) users to create and manage holds
  - Update seat_inventory policies to allow anonymous users to update seat status
  - This enables the app to work without requiring Supabase authentication

  ## Security Notes
  - Holds are still tied to user_id for tracking
  - Seat inventory updates are controlled by application logic
  - Public read access remains for events, seats, and seat_inventory
